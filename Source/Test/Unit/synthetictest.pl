% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% KB-independent unit tests for the resolver core. The resolving module
% exposes a synthetic rule store (resolving:enable_test_rules/0,
% resolving:test_rule/2): while active, resolving:rule/2 resolves
% EXCLUSIVELY against hand-built test_rule/2 clauses, so
% resolver:resolve/9, orderer:order/4 and the prove_with_fallback tier
% chain can be exercised over tiny rule sets without a knowledge base.
%
% Goals are passed as BARE literals (no ?{[]} proof-context wrapper):
% prover:canon_literal/3 canonicalizes the R://- and :Action-shaped literal
% forms used by the production rules, but a bare atom wrapped in ?{Ctx} is
% itself its canonical form, which would make proof/model keys diverge from
% the body literals. Bare goals keep all keys canonical.

% Replace the synthetic rule store contents with Head-Body pairs.

%  Pipeline: prove_with_fallback tier selection (issue #73)
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% The 5-tier committed-choice relaxation chain (strict, keyword_acceptance,
% blockers, unmask, keyword_unmask) is exercised with stubbed failures:
% guarded test_rule/2 clauses succeed only under specific prover:assuming/1
% flags, and a marker literal in the body records which tier produced the
% accepted model.
