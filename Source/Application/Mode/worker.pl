/** <module> WORKER
Compute node for distributed proving. A worker advertises its CPU count on
the network, connects to a pinned portage-ng server (config:server_host/1
or --host; Bonjour may resolve only that pin), syncs its local portage
tree to the server's full git snapshot SHA when the object already exists
locally, then polls for prove jobs and posts back results.

Each worker spawns N threads (one per CPU) that independently poll the
server's job queue.
