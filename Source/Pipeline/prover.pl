/** <module> PROVER
Inductive proof search engine for portage-ng.

The prover is a generic inference facility: it knows nothing about
resolving, ordering, or any other pipeline phase.  Callers hand it a
rule module together with the goals (`prover:prove(Rules, ...)`), and
every rule expansion during that pass resolves against `Rules:rule/2`.
The pipeline stages own the pairing: the resolver proves with the
`resolving` rule set (pass 1: what — versions, USE, slots), the orderer
proves with the `ordering` rule set (pass 2: when — waves).  Callers
that sit outside any pass (e.g. query-side model construction) fall
back to `config:default_rules/1`.

Given a list of target literals the prover constructs four artefacts
(all implemented as AVL trees / `library(assoc)`):

- Proof       -- maps `rule(Lit)` / `assumed(rule(Lit))` to
                 `dep(DepCount, Body)?Ctx`, recording which rule was
                 applied for each literal and its dependency body.
- Model       -- maps `Lit` to `Ctx`, recording every proven literal
                 and the context under which it was proven.
- Constraints -- accumulated constraint terms (`constraint(Key:{Val})`),
                 threaded through proof steps and unified incrementally.
- Triggers    -- reverse-dependency index: for each proven body literal,
                 lists the head literals that depend on it.

Key design points:

- Reprove (iterative constraint refinement): after a complete proof
  attempt, accumulated constraints may reveal conflicts that were
  invisible during depth-first search (e.g. two dependency edges
  imposing incompatible version bounds on the same package).  When
  the domain detects such a conflict, it throws a
  `prover_reprove(Info)` exception.  The prover catches it,
  delegates to the domain hook `heuristic:handle_reprove(Info, Added)`
  which records *no-goods* (rejected candidates) to avoid repeating
  the same choice, and then restarts the proof from scratch.  This
  bounded learn-and-restart loop runs up to `reprove_max_retries`
  times.  If retries are exhausted, a final attempt runs with
  reprove disabled so the proof can complete (possibly with
  assumptions).

- Learned constraints: a key-value store (`prover:learn/3`,
  `prover:learned/2`) persists constraint information *across*
  reprove attempts within the same top-level prove call.  The domain
  uses this to carry narrowed version domains, exclusion sets, or
  other refinements from one attempt to the next, guiding candidate
  selection towards a conflict-free proof.  The store is reset at
  the boundary of each top-level `prover:prove/10` invocation.

- Cycle detection and cycle-break assumptions: during depth-first
  proof search, a per-proof *cycle stack* tracks literals currently
  being proved.  When a literal is encountered that is already on
  the stack, the prover consults the domain hook `heuristic:cycle_benign/2`
  (if defined) before deciding how to handle the cycle:

  * *Benign cycle* (`heuristic:cycle_benign(Lit, CyclePath)` succeeds): the literal
    is already being resolved by an ancestor on the proof stack and
    the domain considers the cycle harmless.  The prover treats it as
    already proven -- it adds `Lit` to the Model and continues without
    recording any assumption.  No `assumed(rule(Lit))` key is stored.
    This matches the behaviour of resolvers like Portage that silently
    handle dependency-level self-referential cycles.

  * *Structural cycle* (hook absent or fails): the prover records a
    cycle-break assumption.  In Proof, cycle-breaks appear under the
    key `assumed(rule(Lit))` (as opposed to `rule(Lit)` for normally
    proven literals).  In Model, they appear as `assumed(Lit)`.

  Both are distinct from *domain-level* assumptions introduced by the
  rule layer via `rule(assumed(X), [])`.

- Triggers form a reverse-dependency index: for each body literal B
  that appears in a proven rule `rule(H, [..., B, ...])`, Triggers
  maps B to the list of head literals H that depend on it.  This
  allows downstream consumers (the orderer) to answer "which
  heads are affected if B changes?" in O(1).  Triggers are maintained
  incrementally during the proof: each proven rule adds its body
  literals to Triggers as it is recorded.

- A lightweight =prove_model= variant skips Proof and Triggers
  bookkeeping for internal query-side model construction.

- Proof obligations (`heuristic:proof_obligation/4`): after a literal is
  proven, the prover queries the domain for additional proof
  obligations -- extra literals to be appended to the remaining proof
  queue.  This lets the domain inject derived proof obligations
  (e.g. post-dependencies discovered only after a literal is
  resolved) without the prover itself understanding or encoding
  any domain-specific semantics.

% Conflict-driven partial restart (non-chronological backtracking)
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

% When a completed pass reports a deferred conflict, a classical retry
% throws away the whole pass and re-proves from the original inputs,
% even though the conflict typically invalidates only a small region of
% the proof.  The partial restart instead:
%
%   1. asks the domain which model literals the conflict invalidates
%      (`heuristic:restart_seed/2` — e.g. every action literal of a
%      provider whose USE flags were force-changed),
%   2. computes the AFFECTED SET: the transitive dependents-closure of
%      the seeds over the Triggers index (every literal whose derivation
%      could observe the invalidated ones — by construction this
%      includes the proof targets, so the resumed pass re-reaches every
%      pruned literal that is still needed),
%   3. prunes the affected literals from Proof/Model/Triggers and asks
%      the domain which accumulated constraints belong to the affected
%      region (`heuristic:restart_constraint_scope/3` +
%      `heuristic:restart_drop_constraint/2`),
%   4. resumes proving from the pruned artifacts: unaffected literals
%      hit the `proven` fast path, affected ones re-derive with the
%      conflict resolution (e.g. learned USE forces) applied.
%
% The mechanism is fully generic: what constitutes a seed, an affected
% constraint, or per-pass domain state to preserve on resume is decided
% by the heuristic hooks.  Without those hooks (or with
% config:reprove_partial_restart(false)) the prover falls back to the

      %          (NewBody \ OldBody).
      %
      %   (b) `should_union_ctx/1` fails (default for any literal)
      %       => fall through to the `regular proof` branch below,
      %          which overwrites the stored Ctx with the incoming
      %          proof context and re-walks the body.
      %
      % (a) is needed when the rule body depends on Ctx in a way that
      % requires merging across multiple call sites (e.g. accumulating
      % per-package constraints from siblings). (b) is the classical
      % proof behaviour and is correct for literals whose Ctx is
      % per-edge plumbing rather than per-package state.
      %
