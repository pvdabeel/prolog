Test Case: test32
Organization:
- os-1.0: A meta-package with USE-driven dependencies.
- linux-1.0: A package pulled in by the 'linux' USE flag.
- darwin-1.0: A package pulled in by the 'darwin' USE flag.

Dependency Graph:
- os-1.0 has IUSE="linux darwin".
- os-1.0 has REQUIRED_USE="^^ ( linux darwin )".
- os-1.0 DEPEND="linux? ( test32/linux ) darwin? ( test32/darwin )".

What is being tested:
This test case examines the interplay between REQUIRED_USE and conditional dependencies. The 'os-1.0' package must have exactly one of 'linux' or 'darwin' enabled. The choice of which flag is enabled will then trigger the corresponding dependency.

Expected Outcome:
The prover should satisfy the REQUIRED_USE by making a choice. For example, it might enable the 'linux' flag. This action should then trigger the conditional dependency, pulling 'linux-1.0' into the installation plan. A valid proof will include os-1.0 and either linux-1.0 or darwin-1.0.
