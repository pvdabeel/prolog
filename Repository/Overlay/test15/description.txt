Test Case: test15
Organization:
- app-1.0: Main application with a negative conditional dependency.
- lib-1.0: An optional library.
- db-1.0, os-1.0, web-1.0: Other standard packages.

Dependency Graph:
- app-1.0 has IUSE="nolib".
- app-1.0 DEPEND="test15/os !nolib? ( test15/lib )"
- The dependency on lib-1.0 is active only if the 'nolib' USE flag is DISABLED.

What is being tested:
This test case is similar to test14 but uses a negative USE conditional. The dependency is triggered by the absence of a USE flag.

Expected Outcome:
- If the 'nolib' flag is enabled for app-1.0, the proof should succeed without pulling in 'lib-1.0'.
- If the 'nolib' flag is not set (i.e., disabled by default), the proof should succeed and correctly include 'lib-1.0' as a dependency.
