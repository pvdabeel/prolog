Test Case: test39
Organization:
- app-1.0: An application with a negative weak conditional USE dependency.
- os-1.0: A package that provides the USE flag.

Dependency Graph:
- app-1.0 has IUSE="linux".
- app-1.0 DEPEND="test39/os[-linux?]"

What is being tested:
This test case checks the handling of a negative weak USE dependency. The dependency `os[-linux?]` means that 'os-1.0' will have the 'linux' flag disabled *only if* 'app-1.0' also has the 'linux' flag disabled.

Expected Outcome:
- If 'app-1.0' is proven with USE="-linux", the prover should enforce USE="-linux" on 'os-1.0'.
- If 'app-1.0' is proven with USE="linux", the 'linux' flag on 'os-1.0' is not constrained by this dependency.
The proof should be valid in both scenarios.
