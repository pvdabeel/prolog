Test Case: test60
Organization:
- os-1.0: Chooses one OS provider via any-of (||).
- windows-1.0, windows-2.0: Two versions of the same package name.
- app-1.0: Has a versioned blocker !<windows-2.0 (soft blocker).

Dependency Graph:
- os-1.0 -> || ( =windows-1.0 =windows-2.0 )
- app-1.0 -> os-1.0
- app-1.0 blocks !<windows-2.0

What is being tested:
Versioned (soft) blockers like !<cat/pkg-version as used by Portage.

Expected Outcome:
The solver should avoid selecting windows-1.0 and select windows-2.0 in order to
avoid violating the blocker constraint.
