Test Case: test34
Organization:
- app-1.0: An application that requires a USE flag to be disabled.
- os-1.0: A package that provides the USE flag.

Dependency Graph:
- app-1.0 -> test34/os[-linux]
- os-1.0 has IUSE="linux darwin".

What is being tested:
This test case is the inverse of test33. It checks the handling of a negative USE dependency. The 'app-1.0' package requires that 'os-1.0' be built with the 'linux' USE flag disabled.

Expected Outcome:
The prover must ensure the 'linux' flag is disabled for 'os-1.0'. The proof should be valid, showing that 'os-1.0' is built with USE="-linux".
