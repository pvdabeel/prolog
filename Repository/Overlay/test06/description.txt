Test Case: test06
Organization:
- app-1.0: The main application package.
- db-1.0: A database package.
- os-1.0: An operating system package.
- web-1.0: A web server package.

Dependency Graph:
- app-1.0 -> db-1.0, os-1.0
- db-1.0 -> os-1.0
- os-1.0 -> web-1.0
- web-1.o -> os-1.0 (Circular Dependency)

What is being tested:
This test case introduces an indirect, or mutual, circular dependency. The 'os-1.0' package depends on 'web-1.0', which in turn depends back on 'os-1.0'. This creates a deadlock where neither package can be installed before the other.

Expected Outcome:
The prover should detect this indirect circular dependency and fail to produce a valid proof. It needs to trace the dependency chain and recognize the loop between the two packages.
