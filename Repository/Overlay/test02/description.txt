Testing simple dependency resolution with versioning.

Expected Outcome: 

Step 1: Parallel download of os,db,app and web.
Step 2: Install os.
Step 3: Run os.
Step 4: Parallel install of app, db and web, (which all depend on os). 
Step 5: Test run db.
Step 6: Test run app (which runtime depends on db).
Step 7: Test run web (which runtime depends on app).

The plan should contain only version 2.0 of os, db, app and web. 
No version 1.0 packages should be proposed in the initial plan.
