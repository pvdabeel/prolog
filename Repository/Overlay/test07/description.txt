Test Case: test07
Organization:
- app-1.0: The main application package.
- db-1.e: A database package.
- os-1.0: An operating system package.
- web-1.0: A web server package.

Dependency Graph:
- app-1.0 -> db-1.0, os-1.0
- db-1.0 -> os-1.0
- os-1.0 (runtime) -> web-1.0
- web-1.0 (compile) -> os-1.0 (Circular Dependency)

What is being tested:
This test case presents a circular dependency that spans across different dependency types (compile vs. runtime). 'os-1.0' needs 'web-1.0' to run, but 'web-1.0' needs 'os-1.0' to be built. This creates a logical impossibility for the installer.

Expected Outcome:
The prover must be able to trace dependencies across both DEPEND and RDEPEND scopes to identify this complex circular dependency. It should fail and report the cyclic dependency.
