Test Case: test10
Organization:
- app-1.0: The main application package.
- db-1.0: A database package.
- os-1.0: An operating system package.
- web-1.0: A web server package.

Dependency Graph:
- app-1.0 -> db-1.0, os-1.0
- db-1.0 -> os-1.0
- os-1.0 (runtime) -> test10/notexists (Missing Dependency)

What is being tested:
This is a variation of test09. It checks for a missing dependency, but this time in the runtime (RDEPEND) scope. The 'os-1.0' package requires 'test10/notexists' to run.

Expected Outcome:
The prover should fail to find the 'notexists' package and report the missing runtime dependency, leading to a failed proof.
