Test Case: test57
Organization:
- virtualsdk-1.0: A "virtual" package implemented as a normal ebuild.
- linux-1.0: A concrete provider pulled in by the virtual ebuild.
- os-1.0: Depends on virtualsdk.
- app-1.0, db-1.0, web-1.0: Standard packages to build a small plan.

Dependency Graph:
- os-1.0 -> virtualsdk-1.0
- virtualsdk-1.0 -> linux-1.0

What is being tested:
This test validates that dependencies of a virtual-style ebuild are traversed and
that its provider package is included in the proof/model.

Expected Outcome:
When proving web-1.0, the plan/model should include linux-1.0 (via virtualsdk-1.0).
