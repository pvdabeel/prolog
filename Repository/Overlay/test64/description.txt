test64: openmp-style USE-conditional churn reproducer

Goal
----
Reproduce the small backtracking/churn pattern observed for:

  portage://'llvm-runtimes/openmp-21.1.8':run

in a tiny overlay-only setup. The real openmp metadata includes:
- IUSE flags like gdb-plugin, hwloc
- DEPEND/RDEPEND gated by those flags
- REQUIRED_USE with a ^^ group under gdb-plugin
- a few unconditional build deps (perl, ninja, cmake)

This test mirrors that structure with dummy packages so we can iterate quickly.
