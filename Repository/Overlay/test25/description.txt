Test Case: test25
Organization:
- app-1.0: Main application.
- os-1.0: An operating system meta-package.
- linux-1.0, bsd-1.0, windows-1.0: Concrete OS choices.
- db-1.0, web-1.0: Other packages.

Dependency Graph:
- app-1.0 -> os-1.0
- os-1.0 (compile) -> ?? ( test25/linux test25/bsd test25/windows )
- os-1.0 (runtime) -> ?? ( test25/linux test25/bsd test25/windows )

What is being tested:
This test case combines test23 and test24. The 'os-1.0' package has the same 'at-most-one-of' choice group in both its compile-time and runtime dependencies.

Expected Outcome:
The prover should resolve both dependencies by choosing to install none of the optional packages, as this is the simplest valid solution. The proof should be valid.
