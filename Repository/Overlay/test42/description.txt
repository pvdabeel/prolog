Test Case: test42
Organization:
- app-1.0: An application that depends on any slot of a package.
- lib-1.0: A library in slot "1".
- lib-2.0: A newer version of the library in slot "2".

Dependency Graph:
- app-1.0 -> test42/lib:*

What is being tested:
This test case checks the prover's behavior with a wildcard slot dependency. 'app-1.0' requires 'lib', but it doesn't care which slot is used.

Expected Outcome:
Given the choice between two valid slots, the prover should follow the default behavior of picking the latest version, which is 'lib-2.0' in slot "2". The proof should be valid.
