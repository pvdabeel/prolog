Test Case: test38
Organization:
- app-1.0: An application with a weak conditional USE dependency.
- os-1.0: A package that provides the USE flag.

Dependency Graph:
- app-1.0 has IUSE="linux".
- app-1.0 DEPEND="test38/os[linux?]"

What is being tested:
This test case checks the handling of a weak USE dependency. The dependency `os[linux?]` means that 'os-1.0' will have the 'linux' flag enabled *only if* 'app-1.0' also has the 'linux' flag enabled. It does not force the flag to be enabled on 'app-1.0'.

Expected Outcome:
- If 'app-1.0' is proven with USE="linux", the prover should enforce USE="linux" on 'os-1.0'.
- If 'app-1.0' is proven with USE="-linux", the 'linux' flag on 'os-1.0' is not constrained by this dependency and can be either on or off (defaulting to off).
The proof should be valid in both scenarios.
