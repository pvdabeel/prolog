test65: build_with_use reinstall semantics (installed must satisfy incoming build_with_use)

Goal
----
Regression test for the rule-level check:

  rules:installed_entry_satisfies_build_with_use/2

We ensure that an installed VDB entry cannot be treated as satisfying a dependency
if incoming `build_with_use:[...]` requires a flag that the installed package was
not built with.

This test is intentionally lightweight and does not require modifying md5-cache or
the VDB; it just uses an always-false flag requirement against an arbitrary
installed package.
