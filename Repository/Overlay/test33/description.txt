Test Case: test33
Organization:
- app-1.0: An application that requires a specific USE flag.
- os-1.0: A package that provides the required USE flag.

Dependency Graph:
- app-1.0 -> test33/os[linux]
- os-1.0 has IUSE="linux darwin".

What is being tested:
This test case examines a direct USE dependency. The 'app-1.0' package requires that 'os-1.0' be built with the 'linux' USE flag enabled.

Expected Outcome:
The prover should identify the USE requirement and enable the 'linux' flag for 'os-1.0' when resolving its dependencies. The final proof should be valid and show that 'os-1.0' is built with USE="linux".
