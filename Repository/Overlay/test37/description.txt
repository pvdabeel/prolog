Test Case: test37
Organization:
- app-1.0: An application with an inverse conditional USE dependency.
- os-1.0: A package that provides the USE flag.

Dependency Graph:
- app-1.0 has IUSE="linux".
- app-1.0 DEPEND="test37/os[!linux=]"

What is being tested:
This test case checks the handling of an inverse conditional USE dependency. The dependency `os[!linux=]` means that the 'linux' flag on 'os-1.0' must be the inverse of the setting on 'app-1.0'.

Expected Outcome:
- If 'app-1.0' is proven with USE="linux", the prover must enforce USE="-linux" on 'os-1.0'.
- If 'app-1.0' is proven with USE="-linux", the prover must enforce USE="linux" on 'os-1.0'.
The proof should be valid in both scenarios.
