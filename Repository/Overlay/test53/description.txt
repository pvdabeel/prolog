Test Case: test53
Organization:
- app-1.0: The main package to be installed.
- liba-1.0: A dependency of app-1.0.
- libb-1.0: A dependency of app-1.0.
- os-1.0: A dependency for both liba-1.0 and libb-1.0.
- libhardened-1.0: A conditional dependency for os-1.0

Dependency Graph:
- app-1.0 -> liba-1.0
- app-1.0 -> libb-1.0
- liba-1.0 -> os-1.0[threads]
- libb-1.0 -> os-1.0[hardenend]
- os-1.0 -> hardenend? (libhardenend-1.0) 

What is being tested:
The prover will first prove os-1.0 through the liba path. This means os-1.0 will have 'threads' enabled. Later prover needs to enable 'hardened' through the libb path. The prover should be able to produce a proof with just one os install, for both 'threads' and 'hardeded'. This should also be reflected in the download for os-1.0. Introducing 'hardened' on the already proven os-1.0 should pull in a new dependency on libhardened-1.0

Expected Outcome:
The prover should correctly identify the need for building os-1.0 only once with the two use flags, and the libhardened-1.0 dependency
