Test Case: test59
Organization:
- os-1.0: Has an any-of runtime dependency on data_fast or data_best.
- data_fast-1.0, data_best-1.0: Two alternative providers.
- app/db/web: standard packages.

Dependency Graph:
- os-1.0 -> || ( data_fast-1.0 data_best-1.0 )   [RDEPEND]

What is being tested:
This test validates that any-of groups (||) are treated as "at least one must be
selected" and that the solver selects an alternative and includes it in the model.

Expected Outcome:
When proving web-1.0, the model should contain either data_fast-1.0 or data_best-1.0.
