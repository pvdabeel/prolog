Test Case: test19
Organization:
- app-1.0: Main application.
- os-1.0: An operating system meta-package.
- linux-1.0, bsd-1.0, windows-1.0: Concrete OS choices.
- db-1.0, web-1.0: Other packages.

Dependency Graph:
- app-1.0 -> os-1.0
- os-1.0 (compile) -> ^^ ( test19/linux test19/bsd test19/windows )
- os-1.0 (runtime) -> ^^ ( test19/linux test19/bsd test19/windows )

What is being tested:
This test case combines test17 and test18. The 'os-1.0' package has the same 'exactly-one-of' choice group in both its compile-time and runtime dependencies.

Expected Outcome:
The prover should select a single OS package that satisfies both the compile-time and runtime requirements. For example, if it chooses 'linux-1.0' for the compile dependency, it must also use 'linux-1.0' for the runtime dependency. The proof should be valid.
