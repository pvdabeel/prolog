Test Case: test35
Organization:
- app-1.0: An application with a conditional USE dependency.
- os-1.0: A package that provides the USE flag.

Dependency Graph:
- app-1.0 has IUSE="linux".
- app-1.0 DEPEND="test35/os[linux=]"

What is being tested:
This test case checks the handling of conditional USE propagation. The dependency `os[linux=]` means that if 'app-1.0' is built with USE="linux", then 'os-1.0' must also be built with USE="linux". If 'app-1.0' is built with USE="-linux", then 'os-1.0' must be built with USE="-linux".

Expected Outcome:
- If 'app-1.0' is proven with USE="linux", the prover should enforce USE="linux" on 'os-1.0'.
- If 'app-1.0' is proven with USE="-linux" (or it's disabled by default), the prover should enforce USE="-linux" on 'os-1.0'.
In both cases, the proof should be valid.
