Test Case: test16
Organization:
- app-1.0: The main application package.
- db-1.0: A database package.
- os-1.0: An operating system package.
- web-1.0: A web server package.

Dependency Graph:
- app-1.0 -> db-1.0, os-1.0
- db-1.0 -> os-1.0
- os-1.0 has no dependencies.

What is being tested:
This test case is a basic sanity check, structurally identical to test01. It ensures the prover can solve a simple, valid dependency graph with both compile-time and runtime dependencies.

Expected Outcome:
The prover should successfully resolve the dependencies and generate a valid proof for the installation of app-1.0, db-1.0, and os-1.0 in the correct order.
