Test Case: test13
Organization:
- Multiple versions of four packages: app, db, os, and web (1.0 and 2.0 for each).

Dependency Graph:
- app-2.0 -> =test13/db-2.0, test13/os
- db-2.0 -> test13/os
- os-2.0 has no dependencies.

What is being tested:
This test case introduces a specific version constraint. The 'app-2.0' package explicitly requires 'db-2.0' (using the '=' operator), even though a 'db-1.0' is also available.

Expected Outcome:
The prover must respect the version constraint. It should select 'db-2.0' and then proceed to resolve the rest of the dependencies, selecting the latest available versions for other packages like 'os-2.0'. The final proof should be for app-2.0, db-2.0, and os-2.0.
