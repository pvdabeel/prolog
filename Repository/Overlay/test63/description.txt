test63: required_use use-conditional loop reproducer

Goal
----
Reproduce the kind of prover timeout trace seen in portage for packages that end
up pulling `sys-cluster/openmpi`, where proving hits a sequence of
`use_conditional_group/4` items for flags like:

- openmpi_rm_slurm / openmpi_rm_pbs (mutual exclusion)
- openmpi_ofed_features_* (require openmpi_fabrics_ofed)

This is a tiny overlay-only reproducer intended to isolate backtracking/timeout
behaviour without involving the full portage tree.
