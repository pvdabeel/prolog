Test Case: test23
Organization:
- app-1.0: Main application.
- os-1.0: An operating system meta-package.
- linux-1.0, bsd-1.0, windows-1.0: Concrete OS choices.
- db-1.0, web-1.0: Other packages.

Dependency Graph:
- app-1.0 -> os-1.0
- os-1.0 -> ?? ( test23/linux test23/bsd test23/windows )

What is being tested:
This test case evaluates the prover's handling of an 'at-most-one-of' dependency group (??). The 'os-1.0' package requires that at most one of the three OS packages be installed. This also means that installing *none* of them is a valid resolution.

Expected Outcome:
The prover should satisfy the dependency by choosing to install nothing from the group, as this is the simplest path. A valid proof should be generated for app-1.0 and os-1.0, without any of the optional OS packages.
