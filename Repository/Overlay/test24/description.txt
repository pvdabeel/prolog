Test Case: test24
Organization:
- app-1.0: Main application.
- os-1.0: An operating system meta-package.
- linux-1.0, bsd-1.0, windows-1.0: Concrete OS choices.
- db-1.0, web-1.0: Other packages.

Dependency Graph:
- app-1.0 -> os-1.0
- os-1.0 (runtime) -> ?? ( test24/linux test24/bsd test24/windows )

What is being tested:
This is a variation of test23, with the 'at-most-one-of' dependency group in the runtime scope (RDEPEND).

Expected Outcome:
The prover should satisfy the runtime dependency by choosing to install none of the optional OS packages. The proof should be valid.
