Test Case: test47
Organization:
- app-client-1.0: A client application.
- app-server-1.0: A server application.
- api-docs-1.0: A documentation package.

Dependency Graph:
- app-client-1.0 (compile) -> api-docs-1.0
- api-docs-1.0 (runtime) -> app-server-1.0
- app-server-1.0 (runtime) -> app-client-1.0 (Circular Dependency)

What is being tested:
This test case presents a more complex, three-way circular dependency. The client needs the docs to build, the docs need the server to run, and the server needs the client to run. This creates a loop that cannot be resolved.

Expected Outcome:
The prover should be able to trace the dependency chain through all three packages and identify the circular dependency, causing the proof to fail.
