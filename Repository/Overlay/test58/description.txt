Test Case: test58
Organization:
- virtualsdk-1.0: A package that does NOT exist as an ebuild.
- linux-1.0: A concrete package that claims to PROVIDE virtualsdk-1.0.
- os/app/db/web: standard packages.

Dependency Graph:
- os-1.0 -> test58/virtualsdk
- linux-1.0 PROVIDE -> test58/virtualsdk

What is being tested:
PROVIDE-based virtual satisfaction. This is deprecated in PMS but still appears
in the wild and is a good regression test for provider resolution.

Expected Outcome:
Currently: expected failure (XFAIL) until PROVIDE/provider resolution is implemented.
Eventually: proving web-1.0 should pull in linux-1.0 to satisfy test58/virtualsdk.
