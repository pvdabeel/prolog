Test Case: test40
Organization:
- os-1.0: A single package with a REQUIRED_USE constraint.

Dependency Graph:
- os-1.0 has IUSE="linux darwin".
- os-1.0 has REQUIRED_USE="|| ( linux darwin )".

What is being tested:
This test case checks the prover's ability to handle a REQUIRED_USE 'any-of' (||) constraint on a standalone package. To install 'os-1.0', the user or the configuration must ensure that at least one of the 'linux' or 'darwin' USE flags is enabled.

Expected Outcome:
- If the prover is run for 'os-1.0' and the configuration provides either USE="linux" or USE="darwin", the proof should be valid.
- If no configuration is provided, the prover should make a choice and enable one of the flags to satisfy the constraint, resulting in a valid proof.
- If the configuration explicitly disables both (e.g., USE="-linux -darwin"), the proof should fail.
