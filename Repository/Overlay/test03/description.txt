Test Case: test03
Organization:
- app-1.0: The main application package.
- db-1.0: A database package.
- os-1.0: An operating system package.
- web-1.0: A web server package (not involved in the dependency cycle).

Dependency Graph:
- app-1.0 -> db-1.0, os-1.0
- db-1.0 -> os-1.0
- os-1.0 -> os-1.0 (Circular Dependency)

What is being tested:
This test case is designed to check the prover's ability to detect and handle a direct circular dependency. The 'os-1.0' package lists itself as a compile-time dependency, creating a loop that cannot be resolved.

Expected Outcome:
The prover should identify the circular dependency and fail to produce a valid installation proof. The process should terminate gracefully, reporting the cyclic dependency as the reason for failure.
