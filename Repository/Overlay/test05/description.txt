Test Case: test05
Organization:
- app-1.0: The main application package.
- db-1.0: A database package.
- os-1.0: An operating system package.
- web-1.0: A web server package (not involved in the dependency cycle).

Dependency Graph:
- app-1.0 -> db-1.0, os-1.0
- db-1.0 -> os-1.0
- os-1.0 (compile) -> os-1.0 (Circular Dependency)
- os-1.0 (runtime) -> os-1.0 (Circular Dependency)

What is being tested:
This test case combines the scenarios from test03 and test04. The 'os-1.0' package has both a compile-time (DEPEND) and a runtime (RDEPEND) circular dependency on itself. This is a more complex version of a circular dependency.

Expected Outcome:
The prover should identify the circular dependencies and fail to produce a valid installation proof. It should not be confused by the presence of both types of circular dependencies.
