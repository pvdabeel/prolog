Test Case: test01
Organization:
- app-1.0: The main application package.
- db-1.0: A database package, dependency of app-1.0.
- os-1.0: An operating system package, a fundamental dependency for both app-1.0 and db-1.0.

Dependency Graph:
- app-1.0 (compile) -> os-1.0
- app-1.0 (runtime) -> db-1.0, os-1.0
- db-1.0 (compile) -> os-1.0
- db-1.0 (runtime) -> os-1.0

What is being tested:
This test case evaluates the prover's ability to resolve a simple, valid dependency tree. It involves both compile-time (DEPEND) and runtime (RDEPEND) dependencies. The graph is straightforward, with 'os-1.0' being a shared, common dependency.

Expected Outcome:
The prover should successfully resolve the dependencies and generate a valid installation proof. The final plan should reflect the correct installation order, ensuring 'os-1.0' is installed before 'db-1.0' and 'app-1.0', and 'db-1.0' before 'app-1.0'.
