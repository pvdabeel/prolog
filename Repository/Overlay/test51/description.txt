Test Case: test51
Organization:
- app-1.0: An application that requires a specific USE flag.
- os-1.0: A package with a conflicting REQUIRED_USE constraint.

Dependency Graph:
- app-1.0 -> test51/os[linux]
- os-1.0 has REQUIRED_USE="!linux".

What is being tested:
This test case presents a direct and unsolvable conflict between a dependency's USE requirement and the target package's REQUIRED_USE. 'app-1.0' needs 'os-1.0' with the 'linux' flag, but 'os-1.0' explicitly forbids that flag from being enabled.

Expected Outcome:
The prover should immediately detect the contradiction between the USE dependency and the REQUIRED_USE constraint and fail to produce a valid proof.
