Test Case: test44
Organization:
- app-1.0: An application that depends on a specific sub-slot.
- lib-1.0: A library in slot "1/A".
- lib-1.1: A library in slot "1/B".
- lib-2.0: A library in slot "2".

Dependency Graph:
- app-1.0 -> test44/lib:1/A

What is being tested:
This test case checks the prover's ability to resolve dependencies based on sub-slots. 'app-1.0' requires a version of 'lib' in slot "1" and sub-slot "A".

Expected Outcome:
The prover should correctly select 'lib-1.0' to satisfy the sub-slot dependency. It should ignore 'lib-1.1' (wrong sub-slot) and 'lib-2.0' (wrong slot). The proof should be valid.
