Test Case: test62
Organization:
- web-1.0: Root package.
- a-1.0, b-1.0: Mutual dependency cycle.

Dependency Graph:
- web-1.0 -> a, b
- a-1.0   -> b
- b-1.0   -> a

What is being tested:
- Prover termination in the presence of a dependency cycle (no blockers, no slots).
- Whether per-goal context growth (e.g. accumulating `self(...)` or slot markers)
  can defeat cycle detection and cause "infinite" backtracking until timeout.

Expected Outcome:
- Either the prover terminates quickly with a finite model/plan, or it fails fast.
- It must NOT spin/backtrack indefinitely.
