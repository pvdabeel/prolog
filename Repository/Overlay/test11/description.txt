Test Case: test11
Organization:
- app-1.0: The main application package.
- db-1.0: A database package.
- os-1.0: An operating system package.
- web-1.0: A web server package.

Dependency Graph:
- app-1.0 -> db-1.0, os-1.0
- db-1.0 -> os-1.0
- os-1.0 (compile) -> test11/notexists (Missing Dependency)
- os-1.0 (runtime) -> test11/notexists (Missing Dependency)

What is being tested:
This test case combines test09 and test10. The 'os-1.0' package has both a compile-time and a runtime dependency on the non-existent 'test11/notexists' package.

Expected Outcome:
The prover should fail because it cannot find the 'notexists' package. It should correctly identify the missing dependency in both scopes.
