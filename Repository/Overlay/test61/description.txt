Test Case: test61
Organization:
- app-1.0: Root package.
- a-1.0, b-1.0: Mutually recursive deps using bracketed USE constraints.

Dependency Graph:
- app-1.0 -> test61/a
- a-1.0   -> test61/b[foo]
- b-1.0   -> test61/a[foo]

What is being tested:
- Termination / cycle handling when bracketed USE deps are present.
- Ensures `build_with_use(...)` context does not grow unbounded in cycles.

Expected Outcome:
- The solver should terminate quickly (either by cycle breaking, or by producing a finite plan),
  and should not spin/backtrack indefinitely.
