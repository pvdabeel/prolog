Test Case: test09
Organization:
- app-1.0: The main application package.
- db-1.0: A database package.
- os-1.0: An operating system package.
- web-1.0: A web server package.

Dependency Graph:
- app-1.0 -> db-1.0, os-1.0
- db-1.0 -> os-1.0
- os-1.0 -> test09/notexists (Missing Dependency)

What is being tested:
This test case checks the prover's ability to handle a missing dependency. The 'os-1.0' package depends on 'test09/notexists', which is not a real package available in the repository.

Expected Outcome:
The prover should fail to find a candidate for the 'notexists' package and report that the dependency cannot be satisfied. This should result in a failed proof.
