Test Case: test08
Organization:
- app-1.0: The main application package.
- db-1.0: A database package.
- os-1.0: An operating system package.
- web-1.0: A web server package.

Dependency Graph:
- app-1.0 -> db-1.0, os-1.0
- db-1.0 -> os-1.0
- os-1.0 -> web-1.0
- web-1.0 (compile) -> os-1.0 (Circular Dependency)

What is being tested:
This test case is a variation of test06 and test07. It creates an indirect circular dependency where 'os-1.0' depends on 'web-1.0' (for both compile and runtime), and 'web-1.0' in turn depends back on 'os-1.0' at compile time.

Expected Outcome:
The prover should detect this circular dependency and fail to produce a valid proof.
