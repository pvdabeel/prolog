Test Case: test22
Organization:
- app-1.0: Main application.
- os-1.0: An operating system meta-package.
- linux-1.0, bsd-1.0, windows-1.0: Concrete OS choices.
- db-1.0, web-1.0: Other packages.

Dependency Graph:
- app-1.0 -> os-1.0
- os-1.0 (compile) -> || ( test22/linux test22/bsd test22/windows )
- os-1.0 (runtime) -> || ( test22/linux test22/bsd test22/windows )

What is being tested:
This test case combines test20 and test21. The 'os-1.0' package has the same 'any-of' choice group in both its compile-time and runtime dependencies.

Expected Outcome:
The prover can choose any of the OS packages to satisfy the compile-time dependency and any of the OS packages to satisfy the runtime dependency. They do not have to be the same. The proof should be valid.
