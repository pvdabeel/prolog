Test Case: test14
Organization:
- app-1.0: Main application with a conditional dependency.
- lib-1.0: An optional library.
- db-1.0, os-1.0, web-1.0: Other standard packages.

Dependency Graph:
- app-1.0 has IUSE="lib".
- app-1.0 DEPEND="test14/os lib? ( test14/lib )"
- If USE="lib" is enabled for app-1.0, it will also depend on lib-1.0.

What is being tested:
This test case evaluates the handling of USE conditional dependencies. The dependency on 'lib-1.0' is only active if the 'lib' USE flag is enabled for the 'app-1.0' package.

Expected Outcome:
- If the user proves 'app-1.0' without enabling the 'lib' flag, the proof should succeed, and 'lib-1.0' should not be included in the dependency graph.
- If the user proves 'app-1.0' and enables the 'lib' flag (e.g., via configuration), the proof should succeed, and 'lib-1.0' should be correctly included and installed.
