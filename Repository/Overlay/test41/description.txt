Test Case: test41
Organization:
- app-1.0: An application that depends on a specific package slot.
- lib-1.0: A library in slot "1".
- lib-2.0: A newer version of the library in slot "2".

Dependency Graph:
- app-1.0 -> test41/lib:1

What is being tested:
This test case checks the prover's ability to resolve dependencies based on slotting. 'app-1.0' requires a version of 'lib' that is in slot "1". Even though 'lib-2.0' is a higher version, it is in a different slot and therefore not a candidate.

Expected Outcome:
The prover should correctly select 'lib-1.0' to satisfy the slot dependency, ignoring the newer 'lib-2.0'. The proof should be valid.
