Test Case: test43
Organization:
- app-1.0: An application with a slot-equality dependency.
- lib-1.0: A library in slot "1".
- lib-2.0: A newer version of the library in slot "2".

Dependency Graph:
- app-1.0 (compile) -> test43/lib
- app-1.0 (runtime) -> test43/lib:=

What is being tested:
This test case examines the slot equality operator (:=). 'app-1.0' depends on 'lib' at compile time. The prover will choose the latest version, 'lib-2.0'. The runtime dependency then requires that the same slot ('2') be used.

Expected Outcome:
The prover should first resolve the compile dependency to 'lib-2.0'. Then, when resolving the runtime dependency, it must choose a package from the same slot, which is 'lib-2.0'. The proof should be valid.
