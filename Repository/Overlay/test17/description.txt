Test Case: test17
Organization:
- app-1.0: Main application.
- os-1.0: An operating system meta-package.
- linux-1.0, bsd-1.0, windows-1.0: Concrete OS choices.
- db-1.0, web-1.0: Other packages.

Dependency Graph:
- app-1.0 -> os-1.0
- os-1.0 -> ^^ ( test17/linux test17/bsd test17/windows )

What is being tested:
This test case evaluates the prover's handling of an 'exactly-one-of' dependency group (^^). The 'os-1.0' package requires that exactly one of the three OS packages be installed.

Expected Outcome:
The prover should recognize the choice and select one of the available options (e.g., linux-1.0) to satisfy the dependency. Since there are no other constraints, any of the three choices should lead to a valid proof. The final plan will include app-1.0, os-1.0, and one of the three OS packages.
