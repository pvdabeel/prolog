Test Case: test21
Organization:
- app-1.0: Main application.
- os-1.0: An operating system meta-package.
- linux-1.0, bsd-1.0, windows-1.0: Concrete OS choices.
- db-1.0, web-1.0: Other packages.

Dependency Graph:
- app-1.0 -> os-1.0
- os-1.0 (runtime) -> || ( test21/linux test21/bsd test21/windows )

What is being tested:
This is a variation of test20, with the 'any-of' dependency group in the runtime scope (RDEPEND).

Expected Outcome:
The prover should handle the runtime choice group correctly, select one of the OS options, and generate a valid proof.
